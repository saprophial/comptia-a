Format for CompTIA study notes:

'*___*'     --> fill in the blank/straight answer
'*a;b*'     --> multiple answers
'a/b/c/d'   --> multiple choice
';;;'       --> separates questions

Example:

My favorite color is *green*.
;;;
My cats are named *Buster;Moxie*.
;;;
Select the one that's a letter: *a/2/45/9*
;;;

Maybe make a tKinter window class that has a "Show Answer" button which triggers a .config() action to show more text/label objects
Maybe add a checkbox to count correct/incorrect answers (Was my response correct? [] Yes [] No => score {Correct : x++, Incorrect : x++ }
