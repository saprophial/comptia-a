CPU stands for *central processing unit*.

The CPU's main function is to *execute instructions or programs*.

The CPU's speed, or ___, is measured in ___ and rated in ___. *clock rate;
Hertz; cycles per second*

At 3.1 GHz, a CPU operates at *3.1 billion* cycles per second.

In what ways must a CPU be compatible with its motherboard? *The clock rate
must be supported by the motherboard; the CPU must fit in the motherboard
socket; whether to use a 64- or 32-bit CPU*

What two categories of speed pertain to CPUs and motherboards? *Motherboard bus
speed: this is the base clock of the motherboard and is often referred to as
"bus speed". It is generated by a quartz oscillating crystal soldered onto the
motherboard; Internal clock speed: this is the internal frequency of the CPU
and is the well-known number CPUs are associated with*

The CPU uses an internal multiplier based off the *motherboard base clock (bus
speed*

What equation yields the CPU internal clock speed? *base clock x multiplier =
internal clock speed*

How does overclocking work? *Overclocking enables a user to increase the CPU
miltiplier within the BIOS, thereby increasing the internal clock speed of the
CPU. It's also possible on many motherboards to additionaly increase the base
clock, which increases the CPU clock rate AND the speed of RAM*

What are the bus speed and the clock speed? *Bus speed: the base clock of the
motherboard; Clock speed: the frequency of the CPU*

What is the external clock speed, seen on older systems? *External clock speed
is the frequency at which the front side bus (FSB) connects the CPU to the RAM*

64-bit architecture incorporates *registers* that are 64 bits wide.

What are registers? *Registers are temporary storage areas which are,
essentially, the spaces where the values that the CPU is actually working on
are located*

What address space sizes are offered by 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs? *32: 4GB
address space; 64-bit: 256 terabyte address space (note: 64-bit CPUs are
technically capable of more, but they presently use only the lower 48 bits as
more transistors would be wasted at modern address space needs*

The term x86 refers to *32-bit* architecture.

A 32-bit CPU can only address a maximum of *4GB* of RAM.

The *socket* is the electrical interface between the CPU and the motherboard.

Describe the physical features of the socket. *The socket is made of either
plastic or metal and uses metal contacts for connectivity to each of the
pins/lands on the CPU. One or mote metal levers (retaining arms) lock the CPU
into place*

The socket has been considered a ZIF, short for *zero insertion force*.

What is the significance of Pin 1? *Pin 1 aids alignment of the CPU in the
socket, and can be identified by either a white corner drawn on the motherboard
or one or more missing pins or pinholes-- in either case, the feature will also
be reflected on the processor*

What is PGA? *PGA stands for Pin Grid Array, a type of socket which accepts
CPUs that have pins covering the majority of their underside. The CPU's pins
are placed into the pinholes of the socket and the CPU is locked into place by
a retaining arm*

Which processor manufacturer uses PGA? *AMD*

What is LGA? *LGA stands for Land Grid Array, a type of socket which has lands
that protrude out and touch the CPU's contact points*

Which processor manufacturer uses LGA? *Intel*

Which type of socket, between LGA and PGA is superior? Why? *LGA is superior to
PGA. It offers better power distribution and a lower chance of damaging the CPU
compared to LGA*

LGA is also known as *Socket T*.

What is CPU cache? *CPU cache is a special high-speed memory, often located
directly on or in the CPU.*

What type of RAM is used by CPU caches? *Static RAM (SRAM)*

L1 caches reside within the *CPU core*

What is an on-die cache? *An on-die cache is built on to the CPU die, a
particular functional circuit of the CPU.*

How does data go from various caches to the CPU? *Cache 3 feeds cache 2 feeds
cache 1 feeds the CPU*

What differences in size and performance occurs from cache L1 onward? *L1 is the
smallest and fastest cache. L2 is larger and slower, and L3 is even larger and
slower than L2. Frequency of data access determines whether data is stored in
L1 or a lower cache.*

Which cache is shared amongst the cores of the CPU? *L3*

What does Hyper-Threading do? Which manufacturer provides it? *Intel's
Hyper_threading enables a single CPU to accept and calculate two independent
sets of instructions cimultaneously, thereby simulating two CPUs.*

What do multi-core CPUs do? *Multi-core CPUs physically contain two or more
actual processor cores in one CPU package. These CPUs can have 2, 4, 6, or even
8 cores, each acting as a single entity. In some cases these share the CPU
cache.*

Power consumption of CPUs is normally rated in *watts*.

What is TDP and what does it signify? *Thermal design power signifies the
amount of heat generated by a CPU*

TDP does not take *overclocking* into account.

What can a CPU's TDP help you determine? *Which power supply and cooling system
to use*

A CPU's *voltage* will increase as applications demand more processing power.

If a CPU goes beyond the specified *voltage range* for any extended length of
time, it will damage the CPU.

What is the APU? *The Accelerated Processing Unit is AMD's name for CPUs with
an incorporated graphics processing unit (GPU)*

What is the purpose of the heat sink and where is it located in relation to the
CPU? *Located sitting on top of the CPU, the heat sink is a block of metal
which uses conduction to direct heat awa yfrom the CPU and out through its
fins*

What is a passive heat sink? * A passive heat sink is fan-less. It dissipates
and has no moving parts*

What is an active heat sink? *An active heat sink has a fan attached to the top
of the heat sink. The fan plugs into the motherboard for power and usually
blows air into the heat sink and toward the CPU, healping to dissipate heat
through the fins*

What type of metal commonly used in heat sinks offers superior conductivity?
*Copper; aluminum is a less-optimal metal used in heat sinks*

In a PC-based motherboard, the chipset's northbride and southbridge usually
have *passive* heat sinks.

Why is thermal compound used? *thermal compound fills the tiny gaps and
imperfections in the surfaces of the heat sink and CPU in order to perfect the
surface area*

What should be done with a non-new heat sink that has been removed and is ready for
reinstallation? *Any old thermal compound should be removed with thermal
compound cleaner, then new thermal compound should be applied to the CPU cap
before installation*

What is the purpose of a fan installed at the front of a case? *A fan in front
is used to draw cool air into the case*

Of all PC cooling methods, *liquid cooling* can dissipate heat the most
efficiently.

The CPU needs to be compatible with the motherboard for these four factors:  *the type of CPU;
speed; socket type; voltage*

After selecting a CPU, what are the installation steps? *Employ ESD prevention
methods; Ready the motherboard; Install the CPU; Test the installation; Close
the case and monitor the installation (consider monitoring during the first few
hours of installation)*

In what two ways can you prepare the motherboard for CPU installation? *1. To
install outside of the case, place the motherboard on an antistatic mat; 2. To
install the CPU directly onto an already installed motherboard, clear away any
cables or other equipment that might get in the way*

How should a CPU be handled? *A CPU should be held by the edges, not touching
any langs, pins, or other circuitry. If set down, the CPU should be placed into
an antistatic bag or on a mat with the lands or pins facing up*

What are the steps to install to a LGA socket? *Unlock the socket by releasing
the retaining arm(s) and swinging it open as far as it will go. Open the socket
hatch, unhook if necessary, remove any plastic cover; Place the CPU into the
socket, using the arrow in one corner of the CPU to orient it to the white
marking on the motherboard or the socket's missing pin(s). Place the CPU into
the socket, make sure it's flush and flat; Close the cap and secure the
retaining arm.; Apply thermal compoun if necessary and install the heat
sink/fan assembly. LGA normally has four snap-in anchors: press these into and
through motherboard holes and turn each of them to lock the heat sink in place.
Plug the fan into the motherboard power connector.*

Why should you make sure the heat sink is flush with the CPU before the very
first time you turn the PC on? *Once the PC is on, the thermal compound will
start to spread and fill in surface imperfections*

What are the steps to install to a PGA socket? *Unlock the socket by moving the
retaining arm(s) out and upward until open as far as it will gently go; Orient the CPU's arrow on one corner to an
arrow or missing pin on the socket. Gently place the CPU into the
ZIF socket. Make sure it is flush with the socket; Lock down the retaining arm;
Attach the heat sink/fan assembly to the metal clips on the sides of the
socket; Attach the fan's power cable to the motherboard.*

How should you test a CPU installation? *Boot the computer, ensure POST passes.
Enter the BIOS and verify the CPU information is correct. Make sure the fan is
functional. Make sure the voltage reported by the BIOS is within tolerance for
the CPU. Then access the operating system and make sure it boots correctly.
Perform several full cycles and warm boots. Finally, view the CPU within
Windows and with CPU-Z*

What should be done if BIOS doesn't properly recognize a CPU? *Check if the
BIOS needs an upgrade*

How can you verify a correctly-installed CPU in Windows? *Use the Device
Manager, look under Processors*

How can you access the Windows Device Manager? *1. Via Control Panel; 2. Within
Computer Management; 3. Run devmgmt.msc*

How can you access System Information in Windows? *run msinfo32*

What steps should be taken to initially troubleshoot issues booting after a new
CPU installation? *1. Check the big four (CPU, RAM, video card, and
motherboard) for simple connectivity problems; 2. Make sure the fan is connected and functional; 3. Make sure
the heat sink is connected properly; 4. Make sure the CPU is installed
properly*

What are some symptoms of a failing CPU? *Unexplained crashes during boot up or
during use; Computer locks up after a short time of use; Voltage is near, at,
or above the top end of the allowable range*

What is commonly the cause of a bussing noise inside of a PC? How is it
remedied? *A buzzing noise can be caused by a wire or cable brushing up against
a fan. Reroute cables so that they're clear of the CPU and any other devices
(this can also aid airflow)*
