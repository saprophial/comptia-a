The computer requesting a web page is called a ___. The remote computer
returning the web site is called a ___. *Client; Server*

In networking, anything that one computer might share with another is referred
to as a *resource*.

To share and access resources, a network must have the following: *Something
that defines and standardizes the design and operation of cabling, network
cards, and the interconnection of multiple computers; An addressing method
enabling clients to find servers and servers to send data to clients; A method
of sharing resources and accessing those shared resources*

Both clients and servers need *network interface controllers (NICs)* that
define or label the machine on the network.

Besides addressing, what can a NIC do? *A NIC can break files into smaller data
units, called frames, to send across the network, and reassemble frames it
received into whole files.*

How were older network interface coltrollers deployed? *NICs came on an
expansion card, called the Network Interface Card, which was attached to the
motherboard. Only the term NIC is likely to show up on the exam.*

What are the most common network topologies? *Ring; Star; Bus; Mesh*

How is a bus topology designed? *All computers connect to the network via a
main line called a 'bus cable'*

How is a ring topology designed? *All computers on the network attach to a
central ring of cable.*

How is a star topology designed? *Computers on the network connect to a central
wiring point, usually called a 'swwitch'*

How is a mesh topology designed? *Each computer has a dedicated line to every
other computer.*

What concepts are referred to by 'logical topology' and 'physical topology'?
*Logical topology is the ideal topology as laid out on paper. Physical topology
is the real-world, generally messier application of a network topology.*

What is a network technology? *A practical application of a topology and other
critical standards to provide a method of data transmission. It defines
everything necessary to do so.*

Data is moved from one PC to another in discrete chunks called *frames*.

Every NIC has a built-in identifier called a *media-access control (MAC)
address*.

A MAC address is a *binary* number.

.*Hexadecimal* is shorthand for reporesenting strings of 1s and 0s.

One hex character is used to represent *four* binary characters.

MAC address, while binary, are represented by using *12* hexadecimal
characters.

What do all frame varieties have in common? *Contain the MAC address of the
network card to which data is being sent; Contain the MAC address of the
network card that sent the data; Some type of data check to verify that data
was received in full order.*

What algorithm is typically used by frames to ensure data integrity? *A cylic
redindancy check (CRC)*

What is a term for the various versions of Ethernet? *Ethernet 'flavors'*

What three speeds are most commonly employed in Ethernet networks and how are
they named?? *10BaseT (10 Mbps); 100BaseT (100Mpbs); 1000BaseT (1000Mpbs, or
1Gbps-- also called Gigabit ethernet)*

What topology and cable type do the three main Ethernet technologies use? *Star bus topology;
unshielded twisted pair cable*

What does a star bus topology look like? *A star bus consists of a central
bus-- a 'switch'-- to which every PC in the network connects via a cable.*

What is the primary advantage of a switch over its predecessor, the hub? *A
switch makes each port its own separate network, allowing each PC to use the
full bandwidth. A hub did not do this. All PCs had to share bandwidth.*

Describe the physical attributes of UTP cabling. *UTP cables use AWG 22-26
gauge wire twisted together into color-coded pairs. Each wire is individually
insulated and encased as a group in a common jacket.*

What is bandwidth? *The maximum speed at which data can be transferred.*

UTP cables come in categories that define *the maximum speed at which data can
be transferred.*

What are the major categories (CATs) of ethernet cabling (name and speed or
purpose). *CAT 1: standard telephone line; CAT 3: designed for 10Mpbs networks,
a variant supports 100Mbps speeds; CAT 5: designed for 100 Mbps networks;
CAT5e: Enhanced to handle 1000Mbps networks; CAT6: Supports 1000Mbps networks
at 100-meter segments and 10Gbps networks up to 55-meter segments; CAT6a:
Supports 10Gbps networks at 100-meter segments*

What two types of CAT cable are currently most commonly used? *CAT 5e and CAT
5.*

Describe STP cabling. *Shielded Twisted Pair: consists of twisted pairs of
wires surrounded by shielding to protect them from EMI*

Where is STP most likely to be required? *Locations with excessive electronic
noise, such as a shop floor area.*

Why do 10BaseT and 100BaseT standards require two pairs of wires? *One pair for
sending and one pair for receiving.*

100BaseT requires at least CAT *5* to run.

What type of connector is used by Ethernet cables? *RJ-45*

What CAT level must be considered besides the cable CAT? *Connectors also have
CAT levels. Connectors and cables must match*

What two types of RJ connectors are currently used for networking? *RJ-11 and
RJ-45. 11 connects the telephone to the telephone jack in the wall, and is
primarily used for telephone-based Internet connections. 45 is the standard for
UTP connectors. It is visibly much wider than RJ-11.*

How are UTP wires categorized? *Each wire has a number. The number is not
printed on the wire, but every wire is a color corresponding to the wire
number.*

What is the 'plenum space'? *The plenum space is the space in the ceiling, in
the floor, and in the walls, through which cable runs.*

What is the primary safety problem affecting the plenum space? *The plastic
material of common cable jackets is made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), a non-fire-retardant plastic
which can release noxious fumes if exposed to extreme heat.*

How can the safety of the plenum space be addressed? *Special plenum-grade
cabling, with a fire-retardant jacket, must be used in the plenum space. It
costs about threee to five times more than PVC.*

What is the purpose of network protocol software? *Takes the incoming data
received by the network card, keeps it organized, sends it to the requesting
application, and takes outgoing data from an application and hands it to
the NIC to be sent out over the network.*

What is NetBIOS/NetBEUI? *NetBEUI stands for NetBIOS Extended User Interface.
this was IBM's network protocol dtack. NetBIOS handled naming conventions,
while NetBEUI chopped up data for delivery via frames.*

What is a node in networking? *A node is any device that has a network
connection.*

What is a LAN? *A Local Area Network is a group of computers located physically
close to each other. It is almost always a 'broadcast domain'-- a group that are able to hear each
other when one sends out a broadcast.*

What is a broadcast domain? *A group of computers connected by one of more
switches.*

What is a WAN? *A Wide Area Network is a widespread group of computers
connected using long-distance technologies. You connect a WAN using a router.
The Internet is an example of a WAN.*

What type of frames can never go through a router? *Broadcast frames.*

What is the current standard networking protocol? *TCP/IP*

What is the responsiblity of TCP? *TCP handles getting data between computers.*

What is the responsibility of IP? *IP handles the addressing scheme of individual
computers.*

What type of notation is used in IPv4 addresses? *Dotted-decimal notation: four
sets of eight binary numbers called octets, each separated by a period. The
numbers range from 0 to 255.*

What is a network ID? How do you identify it? * *A network ID identifies
which parts of an IP address are common to all of the computers in the same
broadcast domain. You identify it by checking the subnet mark-- which looks
like an IP address with some octets set to 255 and some to 0. The octets set to
255 denote the portions of the IP address which serve as the Network ID.*

What is the network ID of a computer at 192.168.202.34 with a subnet mask of
255.255.255.0? *The network ID would be 192.168.202*

What are the functions of the two IP addresses given to a router? *One IP
address connects to the 'next network', such as the ISP, and the other IP
address connects to your LAN's switch. The second IP address is part of the
network ID and is used to send data to anything outside of the network ID. This
is called the 'default gateway'.*

What corresponds IP addresses to host names? *DNS*

What part of www.whitehouse.gov is the top-level domain? *.gov*

What organization is primarily charge of overseeing domains? *ICANN - the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.*

Define the following: IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.
*A computer's unique address on its network; Identifier of the network ID; IP
address on the LAN side of a router; server which keeps DNS records to match
hostnames to IP addresses.*

What is DHCP? What does it do? *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol; Automates
the process of giving IP addresses to computers via a DHCP server.*

What are workgroups? *Workgroups are the most simplistic of the network
categories supplied by Windows. They are the default for almost every fresh
installation of Windows.*

How is a workgroup controlled? *Workgroups lack centralized control-- all
systems connected on the network are equals.*

How can you share a folder in Windows 7? *Right-click on the folder and select
'Share With' to get the File SHaring dialogue box.*

What do file 'Owner' permissions allow in Windows? *They offer read/write
permissions plus the ability to set permissions for other users on the object*

What is the nomenclature in Windows to specify a particular user on a
particular computer? *<Computer Name>/<User Name>*

How is resource control performed in a Windows domain? *A central server
running Windows Server controls access to the network's resources.*

What is the domain controller? *This is the Windows Server system on which the
given domain is created by an administrator.*

What are domain accounts? *These are user accounts set up on a domain
controller.*

What is 'single sign-on'? *Because on a domain member computer you log directly
onto the domain rather than onto the computer, you can log on to any computer
on the domain using the same domain account.*

What is a homegroup? *As a network type between the simplicity of workgroups
and the complexity of domains, Microsoft introduced homegroups. A homegroup
connects a group of computers using a common password.*

How does the CompTIA exam name homegroups? *The format HomeGroup is used to
address the technology, and homegroup is used to refer to the groups
themselves.*

Where do you initiate creation or joining of a homegroup? *Go to the HomeGroup Control
Panel applet.*

All homegroup data is *encrypted* between systems.

By default, homegroups share what type of resource? *Libraries (not folders)*

What kind of frame gets received by all NICs in a LAN? *Broadcast frames*
